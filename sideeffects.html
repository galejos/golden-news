                    Ride sharing services such as Uber and Lyft provide a convenient and necessary service for the ever growing needs of our fast paced society.
                    Often times we forget the cost that this demand can incur on those that provide the backbone for these services. Thousands of uber and lyft
                    drivers in at least eight cities, including Los Angeles, New York and Washington, planned to shut off their apps and join rallies outside company
                    headquarters and regional offices. The national day of action happens just weeks after Lyft hit the public market.<br><br>

                    “This is an act of solidarity with drivers across the country, and really across the world, who are suffering with poverty wages,” said Bhairavi Desai,
                    executive director of the New York Taxi Workers Alliance, which is helping organize thousands of drivers in New York.<br><br>

                    The work stoppage is part of a growing national campaign for better wages for independent contractors who support millions of trips daily in the United States
                    and abroad. According to a 2018 study by the Economic Policy Institute, the average rideshare driver makes $11.77 an hour after expenses and fees, less than the
                    average compensation for retail workers. Dara Khosrowshahi, the C.E.O. of Uber, earned forty-five million dollars in executive compensation last year. <br><br>

                    The strike was first called by drivers in Los Angeles, who have held protests over a wage restructuring for Uber drivers, who had their per-mile rates cut
                    by 25 percent. Drivers in other countries, including England, are joining the strike with some holding daylong work stoppages and others joining only for a few hours.<br><br>

                    Besides better wages, drivers are calling for a more transparent pay structure, attention to safety concerns, and a right to appeal “unjust” firings with little
                    to no notice. Uber has reported that its drivers have earned more than $78.2 billion on the platform since 2015, and $1.2 billion in tips. The company says that
                    it offers financial rewards for qualifying drivers and that drivers can track their earnings in real time. On safety, Uber cites a number of features, including
                    an emergency button, share trip feature and 911 integration technology in more than 40 cities.<br><br>

                    Drivers will continue to fight for what they believe they are owed, and it won’t be long until we see more and more contractors “walking out” until they come to a
                    conclusion they’re satisfied with.<br><br>
