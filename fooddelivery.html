                    Most of us lead busy, hectic lives that often leave us no time to cook for ourselves or our families.
                    The simple option usually involves pulling up to a drive through window at any number of fast food restaurants
                    to grab a quick bite, but what if there was a way to cut out that part of the process? That’s what several modern
                    day delivery apps such as Postmates, DoorDash, and Grubhub aim to offer to people willing to hand over a delivery fee,
                    tip not included, in exchange for having their meals delivered directly to their front door.<br><br>

                    The allure of attracting new business and repeat customers may seem enticing to some, but as third-party food apps continue
                    to grow and compete in the fight for delivery domination, some restaurants are looking to get away from utilizing these services.
                    Often times they increase costs and complicate restaurant operations and don’t have a significant effect on profit margins. Each
                    app requires its own hardware and software to communicate with the restaurant, causing employees to juggle multiple orders from iPads,
                    phones, and in-store lines. Take Postmates for instance, by the end of 2018, many restaurants reported paying a 30% commission on every
                    Postmates delivery. In Los Angeles, Uber Eats charged 40% for the same service. For a $10 item, that’s $3 to $4 right off the top. That’s
                    not including cost of operation, rent, spoilage, etc all factored in with the premiums these apps collect, some restaurants are starting to
                    see red in more ways than one.<br><br>

                    It’s estimated that more than 78 million people use some sort of online delivery service in the U.S. with revenue well into the billions.
                    So how do we weigh the convenience and popularity of these services with the additional cost to the consumer as well as the restaurants themselves?
                    With the current growth of these companies there doesn’t seem to be an end in sight.<br><br>

                    With this growth however has come a brand new job market for those willing to venture into the world of food delivery. It’s as simple as
                    downloading the app, waiting for a company “starter pack”, and getting out on the road. Delivery drivers for these services are armed with
                    an insulated bag, company credit card, and a full tank of gas. One of these sites, DoorDash, claims that drivers can make anywhere from $12 to
                    $20 an hour delivering for their service. It’s understandable why this may be an attractive option for those willing to set their own schedule.
                    The company does indicate however that gas and car maintenance are the sole responsibility of the driver, so in the end it may not be for everyone.<br><br>

                    The quick rise of these online services has created an ecosystem that needs some tweaking to find a good balance. If compromise can be found for
                    the restaurants that provide the product, along with the a developing job market, and the convenience provided to consumers, it’s not hard to see
                    that these delivery apps are most likely here to stay.<br><br>
